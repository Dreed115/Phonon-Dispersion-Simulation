# Phonon-Dispersion-Simulation
Used a LAMMPS simulation to calculate the phonon dispersion of different materials and alloys using and comparing the diferent potentials for view wich one is better fit to see the phonon dispersion  caracteristic curve

The simulation materials where caracetersitc FCC metals Ag, Au, Al, Cu, Pb, Pd, Pt and an alloy Cu-Ni-Co-Fe-Cr

The atom position and structure file is generated with the lattice parameter of each material, the principal potentials used where EAM, Alloy, Finnin Sinclare and Meam

Results where evaluated in a different program to obtain the phonon disperson curve

Graphics and comparation can be found in Materials_data folder for each material
